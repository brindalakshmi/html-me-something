        <p>In this page, I am going to tell about my home town Kanchipuram, in India. Kanchipuram, in the state of Tamil Nadu, is one of the most sacred cities in southern India and the second holiest after Varanasi. Also known as <em>&quot;The City of Thousand Temples&quot;</em>. 80km southwest of Chennai, it was capital of the Pallava dynasty during the 6th to 8th centuries, when the Pallavas created the great stone monuments of Mamallapuram. Today a typically hectic modern Indian town, it's famous for its numerous important and vibrant temples (and their colourful festivals). Kanchipuram is an important holy pilgrimage for Hindus. People travel from far and wide to admire the magnificent stone cravings, chariot processions and shrines. It's also known for its high-quality silk saris, woven on hand looms by thousands of families in the town and nearby villages. Silk and sari shops are strung along Gandhi Rd, southeast of the centre, though their wares are generally no cheaper than at Chennai silk shops.</p>

        <h2>Some Information of Few Temples</h2> 
        <h3>Kanchi Kamakshi Amman Temple</h3>

          <p>Here the Goddess is in seated form in penance. Enquire about the Sri Chakra placed in front of the Goddess. This is the one of the most divine shrines for Goddess Amman in the whole of India. A massive Temple Complex.</p>

        <h3>Ekambaranathar Temple</h3>
          <p>Here Goddess Paravati made a Shiva linga of mud and She embraced the linga to prevent it from dissolving. Since its made of hand from mud, the lingam also looks a bit conical/Tapered at the top. The temple is supposed to house a 3500 years old Stala Vriksham(a bark of wood is kept) and symbolically a Mango Tree is also there. This temple complex is massive in size. The Utsav Moorhy is kept in a mirrored enclosure giving you a feeling of seeing multiple Dieties. The belief is that you can see all the 108 dieties if you see through these mirrors(as per the Priest there).</p>

      <h2>Some Information about Kanchipuram Silk Sarees</h2>
        <p>Synonymous with the sarees of South India, these are the mark of culture for every south Indian wedding, ceremony or occasion. The shine and durability of the fabric have made these Sarees popular attire among women across the globe. The rich quality combined with an amazing finish make them last longer.<br>The sarees are woven from pure mulberry silk thread. The pure mulberry silk used in the making of Kanchipuram saris comes from South India and the zari comes from Gujarat.
      <h3>Evolution</h3>
        <p>Over decades, Kanchipuram silk has been evolving in terms of design and pattern but hasnâ€™t lost its charm. Initially sold across the world by only merchants, today the real weavers have woken up to their own cooperative societies to sell their woven Kanchipuram silk.</p>
      <h3>Variety</h3>
        <img src ="https://i.etsystatic.com/13701693/r/il/39ebc3/1780330407/il_fullxfull.1780330407_rhrm.jpg" height="240" width="1320"/>
        <p> Kanchipuram silk initially started with the 9-yard sarees that were woven to blend well with the culture of designing and patterning temple stories. Over a period of time, these sarees were converted to 6 yards with gold zari weaving. To make it available for every budget, these days there are Kanchipuram silk sarees woven in artificial gold zari, without loosing upon the shining glory of this textile.</p>
      <h3>Innovation</h3>
        <p>The saree has evolved in terms of textures and shapes have taken over the scriptures and art of the silk sarees. Each texture and desi have a name allotted to it with which it is best known. Thandavalam is one such patterned saree where parallel lines describe the saree. </p>
